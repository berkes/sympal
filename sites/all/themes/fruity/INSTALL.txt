  2. Log into the administration area and go to "site building" > "themes".
  
  3. Enable Fruity.
  
  4. Go to "site building" > "blocks" > "fruity" and move the block called "navigation" to the region called "sidebar".

That should do it, in a "clean" Drupal installation. If you encounter any problems, let us know.
